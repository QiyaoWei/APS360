The .ipynb file is our demo file
There are two other files that the .ipynb needs
If someone wish to run the demo, they should download all three files,
Make sure the three files are in the same folder, and the .ipynb should run as expected


However, it is much easier to just use this link---
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mEK4H2VPEb38oKYzGvYQtLJTmdP0tMl_

(please copy and paste rather than click directly on the link)
Not runnable, but all printed results and comments are there, so it's equivalent to running the file


Also, link to our final report---
