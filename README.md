The .ipynb file is our demo file
There are two other files that the .ipynb needs
So just download all three files, make sure they are in the same folder
And the .ipynb should run as expected

I am aware that you might have to open colab to run .ipynb
So it might be easier if I convert .ipynb into .py
Then someone can just download and do "python ..." in terminal
